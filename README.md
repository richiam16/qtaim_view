This set of utilities were originally created on 2020 to make a python version of Richard Baders original Fortran code to get critical points of an electron density (You can inspect this code in Bader/EXT94). This code constructs the electron density as a scipy object from the information of a .wfn file and can create two types of graphs isodensities and surface. The picture below shows the electron density of bencene got from QTAIM_p_3.py:

Note: A main function is in constrcution, for now the best way to run this code is shown in the example.py file.

The libraries version are shown in the REQUIREMENTS.txt file, a yml verison is in construction.
